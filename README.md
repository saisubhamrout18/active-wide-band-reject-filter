# Active Wide Band Reject Filter

This is a *1st Semester Analog Circuits Workshop Project* implemented virtually using *TINA-TI simulation software*.

## Objective
To design and simulate an *active wide band reject filter* (also known as a band stop filter) using basic components such as *op-amps, **low-pass filter (LPF), **high-pass filter (HPF), and a **summing amplifier* to eliminate a specific frequency band.

## Tools Used
- TINA-TI (Texas Instruments Analog Simulation Tool)
- Theoretical analysis based on circuit concepts taught in Semester 1

## Circuit Overview
The project consists of:
- *LPF* to allow low frequencies
- *HPF* to allow high frequencies
- *Summing amplifier* to combine both outputs and reject the mid-band frequencies
- *Op-amps* used for amplification and buffering

## Output
The filter effectively suppresses a defined frequency band while allowing signals below and above it to pass, verified through simulation waveform results in TINA.
